# The ultimate guide for those wanting to understand some key concepts in Machine Learning. There are three components for the output of the Machine Learning prediction algorithm. This includes the Prediction Function, Softmax Function, and the Cross Entropy Loss Function. We will be using the iris dataset to predict the type of iris flower that each sample belongs to. For those of you unaware of the iris dataset, the predictions may result in 3 different classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, or Iris Virginica. The accuracy of the algorithm will be determined by One-Hot encoded vectors (which we'll talk about later) to predict the class.
